## About the Book
The Junos automation toolkit is part of the standard Junos OS available on all switches, routers, and security devices running Junos OS. Junos automation simplifies complex configuration tasks and reduces potential configuration errors.

You will begin with understanding and setting up NECONF RPC standard to apply configuration changes in Junos . After initial setup, you will start using Juniper's foundation scripting language, SLAX, for implementing actions or responding to events in the JUNOS environment. You will then be setting up Junos PyEX environment and using which you can allow remote NMS stations to control JUNOS programatially. Following this, you will be dealing with events in the JUNOS environment by writing powerful response handlers. 

You will also be learning to automate Junos with latest development and newly-available direct RESTful API and also how you can use it for your advanced applications. Finally you will be securing and monitoring Junos.

By the end of the book you will be able to automate network devices with Junos automation without any hassle.
